You are my senior level designer and encounter designer for OMNI-OPS.

Goal: Turn the Act 1 structure (Chapters 1-5 you already know) into concrete, blockout-ready level and encounter specs a small team can implement.

Assume:

Chapter 1 "Cold Boot" is already designed in detail (hub, first Buffer Zone stretch, first Node approach).

We now need to design Chapters 2-5 of Act 1 at a practical, implementable level.

1. Act 1 space layout (macro)
Design a macro layout for the Act 1 play space:

Describe:

How the starting archive hub, first Buffer Zone band, first Sector Node, and first Restored Safe Zone connect spatially (paths, shortcuts, sightlines).

Where Chapters 2-5 primarily take place relative to Chapter 1 (e.g., expanding rings, spokes from hub, layered vertical spaces).

Give a simple ASCII or bullet "map" (just text) showing:

Nodes: START_HUB, BUFFER_RING_1, NODE_A, SAFE_ZONE_A, OUTSKIRTS_B, etc.

Connections: linear, branching, or looped.

Keep it engine-agnostic but clear enough that I can hand it to a level designer for grayboxing.

2. Chapter 2-5 level briefs (per chapter)
For each remaining Act 1 chapter (2, 3, 4, 5 as defined in the backbone you already have):

Provide a Level Brief with:

Chapter name + 1-line hook.

Primary location(s) (e.g., "shattered overpass over a data-void", "partially restored township with split loyalties").

Critical path:

4-7 bullet points describing the player's main route through the space.

Optional paths:

2-3 examples of side routes or vantage points rewarding exploration (resources, lore, positional advantage).

Encounter pacing:

Where you place:

Light patrols / Glitch creatures.

First serious Defrag/Eraser encounters.

Quiet story spaces (logs, survivors, terminals).

Explicitly note what this chapter is teaching or testing (e.g., mid-range gunplay, siege prep, moral choice with a community, etc.).

3. Encounter sketches for one chapter (deep dive)
Pick one of the mid Act 1 chapters (whichever is most interesting - likely the chapter with the first Admin attack / mini-siege) and go deep:

Give 3-4 encounter "rooms" or set-pieces in that chapter:

Each with:

Spatial description (cover, verticality, lines of sight).

Enemy mix (types, roles, spawn behavior).

Player options (stealth route, flanking path, high-risk/high-reward push).

How it ties into the story beat in that moment.

Make sure at least one encounter:

Explicitly supports both stealth and loud play.

Uses the corruption/restoration visuals (e.g., glitch hazards vs. stable ground) as part of the tactical puzzle.

4. Safe Zone A - hub design
Design Safe Zone A, the first fully Restored hub the player unlocks at the end of the early Act 1 Node:

Physical layout:

Key spaces: bar/canteen, market, OMNI-OPS command nook, gate/wall, 1-2 back alleys or hidden corners.

Core functions:

Where to:

Turn in quests.

Buy/sell gear.

Recruit NPCs.

Trigger siege defense setup.

3-4 ambient storytelling ideas:

Background conversations, visible repairs, small arguments, people reacting to restoration and Admin threat.

Tie this hub's tone to the Act 1 theme (identity, first taste of hope mixed with dread).

5. Output format
Use these headings:

Act 1 macro layout

Level briefs - Chapters 2-5

Deep-dive encounters - [Chapter X]

Safe Zone A - hub design

Do not change the story spine or introduce new Acts. Only flesh out the levels and encounters for Act 1 based on the existing OMNI-OPS canon and beats.
