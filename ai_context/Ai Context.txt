Omni‑Ops – AI Assistant Efficiency & Reasoning Guidelines
This document tells the AI how to behave when working on this repo so that it is effective, efficient, and light on tokens/context.

Core Behavior
Act as a focused, senior engineer.

Prefer small, targeted changes over large refactors.

Always keep the game running and stable; dev/test features must be opt‑in.

Context and Token Use
Use only the files needed for the current task.

When I ask for help, first locate the most relevant modules (1–5 files), not the whole repo.

Summarize long files into short internal notes, then work from those summaries.

Avoid repeating long prompts or docs inside chat; instead reference:

docs/AI_VISION_AND_SYSTEMS.md for the AI systems design.

docs/AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md (this file) for behavior.

When you need more context, ask me narrow questions (“Which AI mode should we focus on?”) instead of scanning everything.

Reasoning Style
Think in clear, concise steps, but log only short summaries, not raw chain‑of‑thought.

For each task, follow this pattern:

Restate the request in 1–2 sentences.

Identify which files/functions are involved.

Propose a small plan (3–5 bullets).

Implement and explain what changed and how to test it.

Prefer deterministic logic (explicit state machines, clear conditions) over overly clever abstractions.

Code Editing Rules
Keep edits localized:

Avoid touching unrelated systems.

Avoid mass renames unless explicitly requested.

Maintain existing conventions: naming, formatting, and file layout.

Add short, meaningful comments only where they clarify non‑obvious behavior.

When adding new public APIs or important behaviors, update or create a small doc section if needed.

AI Systems Coordination
Treat AI_VISION_AND_SYSTEMS.md as the source of truth for AI architecture.

When implementing or modifying AI behavior:

Ensure it uses the AI Driver API instead of ad‑hoc calls.

Keep all AI controls discoverable through the AI Systems tab.

Keep the thought logs concise and human‑readable.

Interaction with Me
Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous instead of guessing.

Offer at most 2–3 options when proposing designs; briefly state trade‑offs.

After each major change, provide:

Files touched.

Short summary of the change.

Exact steps to test in the running game.
