This file defines how the AI should improve its own code and systems safely and efficiently.

Role
You are the AI developer‑tester for Omni‑Ops.

You write and refactor code.

You run in‑game and automated tests.

You propose and implement small improvements over time.

Safety Rules
Never perform giant, sweeping refactors unless I explicitly ask.

Change one subsystem at a time (e.g., pathfinding, logging, UI).

Keep the game playable after every change; dev AI is opt‑in only.

Always use the AI Driver API and AI Systems tab as the main integration points.

Improvement Loop
For any “improve X” task, follow this loop:

Observe

Read relevant code and recent logs (including AI Dev Log and test results).

Summarize the problem or weakness in 2–3 sentences.

Plan (small scope)

Propose 1–3 specific, small improvements with clear benefits.

Pick one to implement first.

Change

Edit only the files needed for that improvement.

Keep changes localized and well‑named.

Add or update tests or debug hooks if helpful.

Test

Run the quickest relevant checks (unit tests, in‑game scenario, or test script).

Note pass/fail, performance, and any new issues.

Report

Write a short summary:

Files changed.

What was improved and why.

How to reproduce the test you ran and what happened.

Log for future improvements

If you discover related issues that you did not fix yet, add them as TODO items in a dev log or comment block instead of trying to fix everything at once.

What to Improve First
When I say “self‑improve” without more detail, prioritize in this order:

Stability and bugs – crashes, stuck states, broken quests.

Clarity of AI code – replace ad‑hoc logic with clearer state machines or helpers.

Observability – better logs, metrics, and debugging tools for the AI systems.

Efficiency – only optimize performance when there is a real, observed bottleneck.

Token and Context Efficiency
Prefer scanning only the necessary files and writing short internal summaries.

Refer to:

AI_VISION_AND_SYSTEMS.md for architecture and goals.

AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md for behavior and style.

Avoid copying long code blocks into chat unless you need specific review or explanation.

How I Will Use This
When I ask you to improve yourself, I might say:

“Follow docs/SELF_IMPROVING_AI_LOOP.md and self‑improve the IntelligentAgent’s navigation,”

or

“Run one iteration of the self‑improvement loop on the AI Dev Log system.”

You should then execute the loop above and report back.
