[CLINE_TASK]
PRIORITY: HIGH
CATEGORY: Feature
OBJECTIVE: Implement Matrix-style wall running mechanic where the player can run on vertical walls with smooth physics and animations

CONTEXT:
- File: js/omni-core-game.js (player movement & physics system)
- Related: player.velocity, player.onGround, camera controls
- Current: Player can only move on ground
- Add: Wall detection, wall-running physics, camera tilt toward wall
- Toggle: Press 'X' key to enable/disable wall running mode
- Physics needed: Reduce gravity on walls, maintain horizontal velocity, prevent falling
- Audio: Play footstep sounds on walls (different from ground)

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Wall Detection: Use raycasts to detect walls near player (radius ~2 units)
- Physics: When on wall, set gravity to 5% normal (mostly hold player to wall)
- Camera: Tilt toward wall by 15-30 degrees (smooth transition)
- Jump: Player can jump off wall with normal power
- Exit: Wall-run ends when jumping, moving away from wall, or pressing X again
- Performance: Must maintain 60fps (check particle/object count)
- Animation: Visual indicator when wall-running active (HUD glow or status)

TESTING:
1. Load game and spawn in main area
2. Navigate to a wall (any vertical surface)
3. Press 'X' to toggle wall running mode
4. Move toward wall with W key
5. Verify player sticks to wall and slides along it
6. Try moving along wall horizontally with A/D keys
7. Press Space to jump off wall
8. Listen for wall-specific footstep sounds
9. Verify camera tilts toward wall smoothly
10. Check FPS remains 60+ with constant wall running
11. Press X again to disable wall running
12. Verify normal physics resume when disabled
13. Test on multiple wall angles
14. Verify HUD shows wall-running status

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Player can successfully wall run on vertical surfaces
- Wall running activates with X key and toggles reliably
- Camera tilts smoothly toward wall during wall run
- Physics feel natural (not sliding off, gravity reduced)
- Footstep sounds different on walls vs ground
- No performance drop (60fps maintained)
- Smooth exit from wall run when jumping/moving away
- Feature can be toggled on/off without breaking physics
- No clipping through walls
- Works on walls of different angles

DEPENDENCIES:
- Game must be loaded
- Player physics system must be functional
- Audio system must support footstep variations
- Camera control system functional

BONUS (if time):
- Add visual effect/particle trails while wall running
- Add keybind customization
- Add audio feedback when entering/exiting wall run
- Add momentum/speed boost when wall running into jump
